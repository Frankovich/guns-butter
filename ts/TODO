Features I plan on implementing:
    -Optionally call api whenever Econ receives a new receipt
    -Optionally pass a file name or method which connects the Econ.ts file to a database so the data is not stored in memory
    -Expiration dates/times on orders
    -Check if order is within expiration period IDEA BELOW
Testing
    -Need to test Receipts are accurate




Expiration date implementation:
    Parse through limit orders and check if they are expired whenever a new order is added to an exchange, if invalid, remove from exchange, if valid either execute order or move on to next order.

Problem: How to return multiple Receipts to Econ from Exchange
