Basic notes for how capStreet and basic exchanges calculate stuff.

Bid Price: the highest bid order for an item, for example: current prices people are willing to buy apples are [$3, $4, $4.5]. The bid price is $4.5. 

Ask Price: The ask price is the lowest-priced sell order that's currently available or the lowest price that someone is willing to sell at. For example: current prices people are willing to sell apples are [$5, $5.5, $7]. The ask price is $5.

    remove exchange name from item class

    check bids and asks with unit testing
